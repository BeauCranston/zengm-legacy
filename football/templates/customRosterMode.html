<h1>Custom Roster Mode</h1>

<p>Custom Roster Mode makes player ratings matter more in the game simulation. It was created for custom rosters where players are all rated very highly, so differences can be swamped by randomness.</p>

<p>This was done by making experience and gold matter less during the game simulation. So a ratings/skill advantage at the beginning of the game simulation holds longer throughout the game. </p>
