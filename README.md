# Zen GM legacy games

This repo contains several games from [Zen GM](https://zengm.com/) which are no longer in active development. All original code (not including any bundled dependencies) is available under the Apache 2.0 license.

[Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/) and [Football GM](https://football-gm.com/) remain under heavy developpment, and their code has always been available [here](https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games). I do eventually want to bring all the other sports up to date, but that will be done from scratch (like I did in 2019 with Football GM) rather than using any of the code shared in this repository.

If you are so inclined, feel free play around with the code and make your own games, either based on these games or indirectly inspired by them.

Happy hacking!
