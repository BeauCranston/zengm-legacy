CFB
------
DPOY, use wins and opponent difficulty.



- football finances

- Trading, easy to fleace AI teams?
- resigning own players too hard?
- mood drops (become favorable too quickly during free agency)

- adjust HOF, now that players have shorter careers? (DONE)
- make HOF awards based (DONE)
- make is slightly easier for player to improve, get higher OVRs?
- make sure all teams have at least one running back (DONE)
- MVP award based on QBR? plus winning?
- remove rebuilding, etc on trade page (unless want to use)

MVP/ROY

- change the formula.

Missing RBs

- for longer term leagues the RBs go missing from starting rosters. Ratings too low?

Scoring too high:

- highest team is 40-45ppg, ten highest are 40-28 when they should be 33-25 ppg (FIXED!)



Bugs

- OT doesn't start with a kickoff? Makes sure half as well starts with kickoff
- Add OT ties

- Custom Roster Mode Broken (Fixed)

- first season allow changes in playoffs, sometimes users get caught by this.

-Live game issues: https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/7f27am

- THE 72 Dolphins achievements doesn't work?

? money ball achievemetns don't work?

Schedule

- change every year (DONE)

HOF

- fix player with QB info (DONE)
- make sure there is balance (too many RB, too few QBs?) (DONE)

- both run and pass stats for OL
- fix defensive subbing issue (check roster size needs to check for defense as well)

Leaders

- add interceptions

Subbing

- offense pretty good
- need to fix defense backups. Too many offensive players squezze out the defenders.
- this also adjusts defensive stats, since currently some players get huge sack totals

Bugs?

- Player Ratings erratic
- draft players rated very low
- hard to keep 45 players under cap
- cpu resigns player at unrealistic deals

Weather

- change in play?

Bugs

- historical team view, doesn't work
- leageu leaders should be full right away
- HOF doesn't look good, RB less, QBs more?

CFL Bugs?

- drag and drop on roster issues from inactive to active

Gauranteed Money
- Split so some not and some is

Shuffle Roster

- Does it work now?, put back in?

Arena

- player page, salary in millions (DONE)
- Game Log broken

Canada Football

- Kicker doesn't kick
- everyone wins championships (DONE)
- team history not showing up (DONE)
- Game Log broken

SImplied player editor script
- don't use json, but csv? Allow game to convert

Salaries too high:
- 70 OVR player asking for 15 million

Playoff Option
- seeding like basketball

Ties
- after one OT game can end in a tie
- how to display etc.

Defensive Player of Year
- make interceptions based on coverage skill? not who is covering, but anyone on team.

Schedule
- non division schedule random, so not same teams every year.

First year playoffs always will play to ensure AI team doesn't screw it up?


Autoplay options menu
- always sign above XX OVR
- always sign
- never resign

Quick Sign
- kind of like watch list
- don't want to negotiate so many contracts

Add endurance to OVR calc now that it is used during games

Improved Trading Block

Ratings rarely reach potential
	- make more like Hockey?
	- or keep like this?
	
Starting field position negative?

New achievements
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenGMFootball/comments/4vhthz/ideas_for_new_achievements/

Team average ratings page
- for skills limit to certain positions
- could show average age, height, and weight. then use these for achievements


Flexible salary, draft classes
	- based on roster file uploaded, salary calculation adjusted (min median and max ratings)



roster UI
  summary of changes
    Replaced this nonsense "offense","defense","kicker","offensebench","defensebench","kickerbench","offenseinactive","defenseinactive","kickerinactive" with three properties:
      offDefK: contains string "off", "def", or "k"
      active: boolean
      rosterOrder: integer, relative to position category (offDefK)
  needs to be done
    auto-sort (needs to set "active" and "rosterOrder" for each player)
    limits (need to add check for number of active players before playing, similar to max/min roster check from basketball)
  notes
    UI updating during gamesim might be non-ideal (see commented out part of mapping in roster.js) - haven't tested it to see if this is purely a performance issue or if it causes functionality problems

-----------------------

1) probably going to need more than two rounds of drafting

(got three, just need to clean up)
(now expand to four) (could have more, football already very fast)
should baseball be more? game already slow

(done - 5 rounds)

2) 2*13 = 26 players. that is 22 starters and 4 subs (need kicker as well) (probably need another profile or two)
profiles
draft.js 70
league.js 279

expand roster to 53, with 45 active (done)

roster - 
11 offense
11 defense
1 kicker/punter

subs
----
offense
defense
k
add punter

long snapper ?

inactive

- done, take colors from baseball (done)
- then sort correctly (need all position, maybe with more profiles)

doesn't put defense in correct spot, need to look into


//                if (numPlayersOnRoster > 15) { // mistake , team.js

3) fix player creation first(draft,profiles), then roster(organize players), then season length, then focus on game



0)
run tests, why is it already so slow?

remove player sorting, does that fix?

is it the # of players?

passing/rushing distributions
http://outsidethehashes.com/?p=60	
	
	
record stats for offensive players (RB,WR,QB)
but also record stats for offensive line (RB stats, QB sack stats for their man, QB sacks total)	
defensive line (sacks,tackles, but also running stats for offensive RB,QB, etc)
CB (tackles, but also wide receiver stats for their man)
LB (could have both)
keep track of total plays, play for their man,
WAR - every play not to them adds to WAR, if to them depending on how play went the WAR could be +/- (can create WAR for every player, defense opposite of offense)

rushing
- 3 yards and under - tackled by correct man
- over 3 yards, missed tackle, LB tackles within 10 (can be based on tackling ability or just LB rush stop ability, with odds) , S within 20, C after
	
passing
- caught
- tackled right away
- if not, who tackles (depending on how deep, best tackler available, short - LB, crossing, S/LB, deep CB/S

	
end on downs,new possession, or points
----------

II) realism/stats

makes sure game look real, 
then put in stats, tackles, offense stats, defense stats plus how opposite offensive player did (for partial players, they can get partial stats, 

III) playoffs/awards

IV) trading/long term plays


1) season should be by week, not day
2) days left should be weeks left
3) fix subbing

- get correct rusher for sacks (I think so)
- adjust fg/ep calc, seems too hard
- check subs - make sure same type of player
- sacks,int,fum,def off stat matches,more offensive stats
     should be ready of Offensive line stats, Defesnive stats for 
- half tackles

4) Game Log
- good way to track if game works correctly


---------------------

1)  ol/dl impact sacks, make sure - impact time through?
2) points too high
- punts not long enough
- unbalance of attack too great when rushing/passing
3) overall game balance
4) passer rating too high for non qbs - look at growth - too fast, make growth stunted if not playing that position
5) sub more
6) passing distributed more
7) remove console.logs
8) injuries - increase rate by 4x
9) adaptive, the more you pass the bigger focus defense puts on it, the more you rush the less focus. so need some balance

10) dashboard
11) playoffs - modified of baseball
12) says days left (should be weeks left)
13) game hangs up when running (infinite loop somewhere?)
14) standings - seeding -> only need  6
15) year 2014

I) 
-playoffs (done) (check rounds won 0,1,2,3,4)
II)
- player salaries
- trade ai
III)
-dashboard

IV)
- google analytics

- other : basketball to football
-logo
-title
-e-mail
-help documentation


V)
-improve game distribution (too much offense, too extreme pass vs rush, adaptive)

VI)
-standings - points for/against


32 teams
- trading block has tids

Roster
- sort needs to be better
a) kicker not sorted right?
- new html - split page up

Salary
- reduce so that teams start under 133, should have so many min players
50 players, 133 is around 3m per players



------------------------

1) WR- need more distribution
2) playoffs - instead of 0,1 show score
3) interceptions too high (fixed)
4) passing yards too high
5) QBR in dashboard

---------------------------

1) Playoff, fix seeding, maybe do GB by WC
2) season, hard code so it doesn't get messed up
3) player season highs can be too high (make defense matter more and offense matter less in outcome)
4) improve look of gamelog (smaller text)
5) popup for games left

6) turnover - make sure yardage correct, opp vs 

----------------
1) active spots, open roster 
2) popup for active?
3) season schedule
4) adjust stats


--------------------

roster debug
1) doesn't pick up changes in active/inactive unless you refresh page
2) when roster moved around by user, players lose order number
a) keep ordered
b) keep track of starter, then reorder during game sim
----------------------


1) salary variance too great, low ovr/low pot guys ask for 10m


2)HOF
qbr: 0 player.js:2203
gp: 16 player.js:2204
ewas[i]: -95 player.js:2218
ewa: -95 


3) WR: on top spot
QB below, why wasn't it sorted correctly?

4) non QB at first spot, should be included in other options (Receiving, OL, can still run) (fixed)
5) kicker injury bug (fixed)
6) player creation bug (fixed)

7) expand HOF to include OL, CB,S
