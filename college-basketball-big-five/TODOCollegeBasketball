either have user pick conference

or sim entire league, about 3x slower than basketballgm

have conference tourny

have 64 tourney
w/ alternate 64 tourney

recruit instead of sign
-based on distance/money/prestige

that is pretty much it



1) get some basic conferences and schedules in (adjustable, based on aggressiveness)
- done
- need to add rest of teams
- top 5 based on states
- next 15 based on cities
2) create tourney set up?
- almost done
- need to make part of regular season

bugs
- not being ordered by conference wins?
post

2a) first tourney still regular seasons, can use current format, but stats still need to be regular season

pretty much done
maybe better display historical conference winners?

2b) second tourney actually 64 team playoff
- take winners of conference tourney
- then seed based on combined rankings

I) make new playoff
create new playoff page
create new summary page (history? look up)
then connect to game
II) similar to old playoff
III) then make first playoff part of regular season

template helpers
conference
    ko.bindingHandlers.recordAndPlayoffs = {
	
national	
    ko.bindingHandlers.recordAndPlayoffs64 = {






3) do recruiting
- distance and prestige impacts mood.
- so only some available (can make very restrictive even for good teams
4) refine and clean up (remove trading aspect)
5) owner message, should be president's message


DI,DII,DIII
rise from DIII? (future game?)
or just rise from worst team in D1?

use this for the teams
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states'_largest_cities_by_population

top four divisions are states

next 12 are state cities



don't forget
1) top 25 rankings (done)
2) conference champs auto bid for NT (done)
3) RPI rankings  (done)
4) power rankings - based on opp adjustment (done)


1) quarters to half
2) draft/free agent to recruit
3) RPI/power  (done)


1) conf summary, player stats missing
not being sorted


1) smoother transition from message to free agency - needs time to process
2) player location
3) team location
4) miles away
5) impacts resigning
6) initial signing price, but no further cost
7) AI, less dropping of players?
8) 


get coordinates for largest cities, used for schools
http://www.geonames.org/US/VA/largest-cities-in-virginia.html

top 5 conferences take top 1-2 cities
smaller conferences get rest

probably want to filter remaining conferences by pop size. So more schools in more populated areas



need to calculate recruiting distance:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
Number.prototype.toRad = function() {
   return this * Math.PI / 180;
}

var lat2 = 42.741; 
var lon2 = -71.3161; 
var lat1 = 42.806911; 
var lon1 = -71.290611; 

var R = 6371; // km 
//has a problem with the .toRad() method below.
var x1 = lat2-lat1;
var dLat = x1.toRad();  
var x2 = lon2-lon1;
var dLon = x2.toRad();  
var a = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) + 
                Math.cos(lat1.toRad()) * Math.cos(lat2.toRad()) * 
                Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);  
var c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a)); 
var d = R * c; 

alert(d);


----------------------

TODO

1) for new recruiting class - add miles
2) make sure contract.amount goes to 0 after first year
3) make sure players stay with teams (contracts should last through 4 years)
4) expand recruiting class? need enough players 12 players/ 4years = 3/year on average (currently only 2 rounds)
5) make sure idle/player/etc match up with 
6) create player contract criteria based on miles/prestige/pasthistory

do next?
7) update free agent page, roster page with correct cash left amount (essentially done, roster page may not need anything (or just ending cash))
8) turn negotiate into sign
- clean up page, reduce to most simple, then put that into free agent page

9) free agent page, remove stats and put more ratings

10) recruiting doesn't scan through every day, just finishes after one day

11) prevent getting recruit that are too expensive


MAJOR ISSUES
1) bringing in team location to create miles for new players
2) changing negotiate button to autosign button



FIXES:
core/contractnegotionation line 29 (negiotiatoin spelled wrong)
core/league.js 557 spelling strategy contending?
js/util/message.js 130 coachs -> coaches

1) sorting currency by whole number, not first digit (e-mail)
2) get miles right (check then e-mail)
3) adjust teams, add location (done)
4) optimize miles/mood/value calculate (getting close) (somewhat, need either 1) more cash, 2) lower player, 3) dramatic drop in needs over time- for some it could go higher, maybe a range of +10% to -20%)
5) add more players (done)
6) fix transition, 1) bring to free agency 2) then do days (currently does days first and all in one step)
7) clean up, remove all non needed salary, budget info (salary palyer page, budget finance pages) (somewhat)
8) owner messages adjust
9) 2 halves, not 4 quarters (done)
10) when payroll adds is combines digits, not by math ( 700 + 0 = 7000, not 700) (e-mail? with sorting contract issue?) (done)
11) achievements (done)
12) upload teams (done), create players, fantasy draft


13) 2nd season, finance cash updated? free agency area yes, but league finance no?
13) 2nd season, player contract amounts not zero?, any impact from this? yes, need to set these to zero

14) make sure cash is saved after recruiting period, not during season?
15) excess recruits from first year need to be in line with excess recruits for next 4 years
- more at start
- less each year after


16) upload teams - give current team set up
17) check player page upload - need location? (less used?)

18) user manual

19) remove HOF?


20) why aren't teams adding players? always allow players to be added if cost is zero?

21) player contract amount - should be different for each team (done?)
22) have computer be aggressive for better players (only look for top 25?) (done)
23) some payroll still showing up, not all players deleted? (fixed)
24) difficulty, set this (done)
25) win 30 games didn't work, check out why (fixed) 
26) recruiting, left and came back, undeined days left?
27) conference playoff seeds correct? 
28) recruit classes after initial set up not being created (seemed there, why didn't load?) 
2019 free agency, new recruits don't load?
2020 they come back
29) make GB just conference
30) so slow to save old player data? does compiling improve?
31) power ranking: show conference?


TODO before going live
32) OWNER MESSAGE (MUST IMPROVE) (fixed)
33) MILES CALC (MUST IMRPOVE) (fixed)

call teams.filter before doing player generate enter team location data into that function



34) CONFERNCE Ranking calc (NEED TO CHECK)
35) Games back?
36) conference rank, by actual tournament, not winp
37) manual
38) when you get fired, can't move on

39) monthly for national doesn't work (may have been another bug)

Would Like
38) SCORES DURING TOURNAMENTS LISTED
39) Allow AI teams to cut players, or make recruiting classes more even (not random for each team) (make go in order when be created)

1) team filter
2) contract sort by string, not int/real
3) three versions of game
