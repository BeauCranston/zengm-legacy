MOBA GM Bugs

- too many combacks from losing an inhib or nexus turrets

MOBA GM Features
--------------------------

- include objectives in graph?


From LOL GM

Patch Tier Display:
https://www.reddit.com/r/zengmlol/comments/7zx9ta/moba_gm_champion_basic_stats_page_updated_edit/durohfi/

Bugs
- barons taken, dragon taken broker in stats, review

- can't delete single league, page broken

God Mode
- allow no retirement
- allow for longer careers and less new prospects

Champion Patch
- length hard coded? User uploaded champs patches never get used

Coach Mode
- create page for picking and banning
- use that info to run live game

BansPicks Page
- use god mode as template?
- or use draft page as template?
lets make a second template

I'm thinking draft
Load all champs, list picks and bans as they get taken and champ pool reduced


0) Play will automatically be a live game in coach mode
1) go to picks and bans
2) then do live game

1) Load game
2) load champs
3) create number of picks/bans
4) then run draft
5) then adjust opposing picks based on team comp 
6) then sim actual game

Bug - sort AI team roster before draft to make sure players make sense?

How to do draft:
1) isn't live game, but similar, it is coached game
2) immediately brings up draft page
3) do the champion stuff when schedule is created? if mode is coach mode?


Champ Name Changes
- DOTA 2 and LOL
- describe as (counter focused - DOTA 2, meta focused - LOL)
- Use useful descriptions of how they play
Burst Tank - Malphite
Burst Mage - Annie

Bugs
- game sim: ensure total CS/JGL doesn't surpass maximize possible
- what would make this deal work on individual teams doesn't include a player from that team (bug with removing draft picks)

Possible Features
- allow players to come back after retirement

Free Agency
- have teams take positinal need into account
- 125% value for missing position, 90% for second, and %50 for third?

http://localhost:3000/
chrome://inspect/#workers

do you need any other coach mode options?

let user then focus on 
early/mid/late aggression? really it is dictated by

MOBA Nice to have:
- free agents, keep track of number of positions each team has, don't want more than 2 from a position

- make resignings always easier with hype higher?

MOBA TODO

- 40 Champion points showing up on CS teams. in summer split, demoted teams?
- GB fix in standings? (DONE)

- regionals and groups use championpoints
- test other game types to see if I broke them along the way

Worlds w/ Splits
- CP doesn't work
- MSI historal all displays wrong winner and runner up

Worlds w/ Splits w/ Ladder
- doesn't save (or just takes forever) when new season starts


Missing Playoff Stats for player:
- stay teams get included because of champion points
- need to ensure those teams get playoff row for types 6&7

Coach Mode
- in game strategies
- champion selection

Display current rankings for picking on a page
Allow selection of champions

More champion data
- countering
- synergy

UI
-------

Get looking good
merge with some of the new features?
Create video (1 min? games simming and results showing up (dashboard), playbyplay happening, free agency)
Create screenshots (edit patch page, edit champion page, edit team page, team history page, league history page (# of champions), player history page (# awards),)

 
Looking really good, much easier on eyes. I enjoy using it now.

Issues I've noticed so far:

1) New image on first page makes seeing Leagues 2 and League 3 really hard. This is tricky because the page is both really dark and really bright in some spots. A few possible solutions:

a) Dim all the lights or once they get to where League 2, etc are,
b) Find a color that works with black and white, and/or
c) I can get the image altered.

2) Tables

a) Tables such as the roster are cut off and have a scroller. I prefer how it was before. Now still have to scroll but see even less. In the future I need to reduce the number of columns and put in place some tabbing to show more information.

b) On the other tables the scroller kind of works, but that is because the seperate columns for the up/down arrows have made the tables huge.

c) The up/down arrow are too white. I notice them more than the title or the data on the page. 

Still thinking about the best way to handle this. Using the old style, but with the arrows not too easy or hard to see would probably be best. Not sure how possible that is.

3) Tools/God Mode had red and green buttons. That was definately better than the current white.

4) Team History color codes the players (the colors are mentioned at the top of the page). That is all missing now in the table. The table is very white as well.

5) Team and player highlighting could be a little dimmer. It is slightly on the bright side. 

6) Highlighting when you scroll over a table on a player/team could be a little more subtle as well. How LOL GM was in the white version as far as color differentiation wasn't bad. Before thing were made a little darker. For us I think we just need it a little lighter. 

7) Similarly with the popup messages when game scores are announced as the season is simulating (bottom left side). I think the colors need to be inverted. Light background with darker text. That way it jumps out more from the page and can be read a little easier. 
Before it was a black background with white text. Now it probably needs to be white/grey background with black/dark green text.

8) Flag by players name puts them on a watch list. When I click the flag it doesn't change color. So I don't know if the player has been added or taken of the list.

9) Left side table I think you made it bigger to fit the whole screen. It isn't so bad. One issue with that is more stuff is coming. So with the current size it will be longer than the Dashboard page. So it just need to be able to get changed easier.
If it isn't easy to change, need should go smaller now. There is at least one and maybe two more links going into that table for the final release. So sizing it with at least those two in mind makes sense now.

10) The menu on left the highlighting doesn't cover the whole row. It starts with the first letter. It makes it a little bit awkward to read that first letter.

11) When you go to tools God Mode and enable it the god mode option in the menu turn purple. I'm thinking this need needs to be inverted. So instead of Dark Purple, it needs to be a light purple.

12) Player names don't have the link color. In general, there are links with just the grey (which looks fine, but may be confusing to users).

I think that covers everything I've noticed so far. This is to start getting it really polished. 

Overall, I really enjoy using it now. I think it is really looking good.

LOL GM FIXES AS WELL

MultiTeam Mode
a) picks and bans work for both teams

Hype
a) should be adjusted in ladder version. Ladder teams should peak at below 1. LCS teams should bottom at above 0.

Dashboard
a) leagueLeaders.ast.pid league leaders should be fgp


Subbing
--------

- rotate among players who are close in skill
- sort by taking into account languages and years with team


UI
------------

Standings - missing player team highlight, when scrolling only highlights every other team

Playoffs - strange color outcomes for background colors

Dropdowns/tabs - all white

White everywhere - too bright, needs to be softened, like the grey, or go with a greenish grey. The grey is smooth to me. The white jarring.

Play button - I thought it was prettier before. 

Create League - button should show it was pressed.

--------------------
others
- links could just be grey colored
- popups could be not black, but maybe not worth changeing now

Free Agency
-------------

- Korean teams only get Korean players (maybe a few other countries, maybe have them be cost prohibative?)
- Make sure free agency work by country/region
- free agency should produce results like starting rosters


Ladder
----------------

// For the larger ladder versions, 12, 20 teams may want to put in an alternative schedule that isn't longer than rest of divisions.
// essentially, use the crappy schedule for ladder and play twice for CS and top league.
// May need to use team MMR for ladder and not raw schedule wins and losses. (MOBA 2?)

-- LOL populatiry level
-- change over time, impact player ratings and how common they are
-- higher the popularity the better the players
-- bigger the country the more common the players

- better teams also see better development of players

- import focus (saved to reddit): team free agency should better match starting rosters, check link for specifics
	make Korean players cheaper to import? more popular the country the better the players (who get paid more, but get paid less on an OVR basis).
	have a distance factor?
	
- scrims? (MOBA GM 2)
